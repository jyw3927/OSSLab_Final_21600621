## Why is this project useful?
I was working on my homework of Data Structures about contacts application.
At that time, I thought that 'How about applying this application to raspberry pi?'.

When you want to contact the professor, it is hard job to search HGU web site to know the email or phone-number of the professor every time.
So I thought that it would be really useful to have the application that could store contacts.

You can manage the contacts in application, and save the changes into a file.
Later, when you want to contact the professor or modify the contacts, this application will give you the great help!

## How do I get started? (+Tool)
1. The source code of this application was written by **C++**, so you have to install g++ in your raspberry pi.
```
	$ sudo apt-get install g++
```
2. Enter "make" command to compile.
```
	$ make
```
3. There will be a executable file "contactAPP".
Enjoy!
```
	$ ./contactAPP

```
